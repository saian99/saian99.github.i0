APP DESCRIPTION: 
  Basic app for the show Rick and Morty that allows users to browse the through the main characters of the show using the carousel slide. When you click on character info. Information on the character will show below.
  
  ADD On:
    Add more css to the site. have episodes appear properly in the div below. Fix the images i am using to show the characters.
    
  TROUBLES:
    The first API i was trying to use was not showing up when i loged it. I had trouble applying an image as the background along with centering the button on the carousl div.
